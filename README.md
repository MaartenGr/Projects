# Data science portfolio by Maarten Grootendorst

This portfolio consists of several notebooks and projects illustrating the work I have done during my studies (MSc Data Science & Entrepreneurship). It should be noted that some notebooks were not part of my master which I created merely to educate myself. 

## Optimize Emté Routes

A project for the course Business Analytics in which we were asked to optimize a certain number of managers visiting a set of cities in the most optimal way. There were 133 cities that needed to be visited. The maximum distance for a manager to be traveled was 400km and we had to minimize the total distance traveled (thereby implicitly minimizing the number of managers). Time and capacity constraints were added in later exercises within this project.

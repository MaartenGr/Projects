## Data Science Portfolio 

This portfolio consists of several notebooks and projects illustrating the work I have done during my studies (MSc Data Science & Entrepreneurship). It should be noted that some notebooks were not part of my master which I created merely to educate myself. 


###  [NLP: Analyzing WhatsApp Messages](https://github.com/MaartenGr/soan/blob/master/soan.ipynb)
* Analyses done on whatsapp messages between me and my fianciee to surprise her with on our wedding
* Methods:
  * Sentiment Analysis
  * Unique words (using TF-IDF)
  * Topic Modeling
  * Wordclouds, etc.

###  [Optimizing Emt√© Routes](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/RouteOptimization.ipynb)
* Project for the course Business Analytics in the master
* Optimization of managers visiting a set of cities
* Total of 133 cities, max distance 400km with time and capacity constraints
* Thus, a vehicle routing problem
* Methods:
  * Integer Linear Programming
  * Tabu Search
  * Simmulated Annealing
  * Ant Colony Optimization
  * Python

###  [Predicting and Optimizing Auction Prices](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/AuctionAnalysis.ipynb)
* Data received from an auction house and therefore not made public
* Prediction of value at which an item will be sold to be used as an objective measure
* Optimize starting price such that predicted value will be as high as possible
* Methods:
  * Classification (KNN, LightGBM, RF, XGBoost, etc.)
  * Cross-validation based on LOO CV (leave one auction out)
  * Optimization (Genetic Algorithms) 
  * Python

###  [Statistical Analysis using the Hurdle Model](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/AuctionAnalysis.ipynb)
* Used Apple Store data to analyze which business model aspects influence performance of mobile games
* Two groups were identified and compared, namley early and later entrants of the market
* The impact of entry timing and the use of technological innovation was analyzed on performance
* Methods:
  * Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression
  * Hurdle model
  * Python, R

## Predict and optimize demand

The goal of this assignment was to create a simulation model that can be used to check the performance of different methods for calculating the expected demand. A retailer has indicated to wanting a tool that can be used to predict how much of a product is needed to fulfill the demand today and the next day. Actual demand was tracked and provided for 2014-2017.

A safety factor Z affecting the forecast error received from predictions (using XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost) was optimized using skopt's bayesian optimization techniques.

## Neural Style Transfer

For the course deep learning I worked on a paper researching the optimal selection of hidden layers to create the most appealing images while speeding up the process of optimization. I used some of the code [here](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/) and mostly worked on researching which style layers performed best in the neural style transfer task. Notebook will follow.

## Predicting Housing Prices 

A project for the course Introduction to Machine Learning. All students were asked to take part into the following kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/). In order to get the highest grade for the course you simply had to end up at the highest position of your class. I scored 1st within the class and 33th on the leaderboard. I used a weighted average of the results of XGboost, Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge and Gradient Boosting Regressor in order to get the best results. All feature engineering can be found in the notebook.

## FitBit

During my master Data Science and Entrepreneurship I was looking at various ways of leveraging data for the purpose of entrepreneurship. I realized that my FitBit wasn't all that accurate and at times displayed weird values. For that reason I decided to create a model that could predict what my heart rate would have been if it were missing (e.g. due to a bad signal). 

This was the very first project I did during the pre-master. Looking back, there are some things I could have done differently. For example, I did a simple 10-fold CV to test my models which might lead to overfitting as the folds are chosen randomly.

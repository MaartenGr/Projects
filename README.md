# Data Science Portfolio 

This portfolio consists of several notebooks and projects illustrating the work I have done during my studies (MSc Data Science & Entrepreneurship). It should be noted that some notebooks were not part of my master which I created merely to educate myself. 

## NLP: Analyzing Whats-App Messages
I wanted to surprise my fiancee at our wedding with a thorough, but sweet analysis of our relationship. For this I created a package that allows you to analyze your whatsapp messages: sentiment analysis, unique words (by TF-IDF like scheme), topic modeling, wordclouds, etc. Working with text was something that we did not get in the master and for that reason I wanted to get some experience with the subject.

## Optimize Emt√© Routes

A project for the course Business Analytics in which we were asked to optimize a certain number of managers visiting a set of cities in the most optimal way. There were 133 cities that needed to be visited. The maximum distance for a manager to be traveled was 400km and we had to minimize the total distance traveled (thereby implicitly minimizing the number of managers). Time and capacity constraints were added in later exercises within this project.

## Predicting and Optimizing Auction Prices

For the course Business Analytics I worked on the following problem. An auctioneer would like to know if it is possible to predict how well a certain item in an auction will do. If yes, can you then change the Starting Price of an item in such a way that it will result in the highest possible outcome of that item. Thus, I started with predicting whether an item will be sold for more than its estimated value or not (a classification problem) and validated using Leave-One-Out CV (leave one auction out). Then, I optimized one auction that was not previously seen using a Genetic Algorithm and a basic heuristic I constructed myself. I managed to optimize the auction such that more profit could be gained from items in an auction.

## Statistical Analysis using the Hurdle Model

For the course Strategy and Business Models I worked on analyzing Apple Store data to get insight into what makes an app succesfull. The main research question of the paper is which business model aspects influence the performance of mobile games in the first five months after they are published between early and later entrants of the market. Because of the highly competitive mobile game market, this study aims to provide guidelines to developers and address the research gap in the literature on mobile app market, namely the impact of entry timing and the use of technological innovation on the performance for mobile games.

## TomTom Heart Rate Prediction

At TomTom I was in charge of improving the accuracy of heart rates of TomTom's sportwatches. I started with a model trained on a chest heart rate monitor and predicting heart rates that were missing. However, such a model is difficult to put into production and does not allow for additional training. Instead, I identified when heart errors would take place (see image below). The signal strength of the green light at the bottom of heart rate sensors seemed to be the culprit. I used good signal strength heart rates as my training data and predicted heart rates with a poor light signal. The result was a 30% increase in accuracy of heart rate compared to a moving average baseline.

## Neural Style Transfer

For the course deep learning I worked on a paper researching the optimal selection of hidden layers to create the most appealing images while speeding up the process of optimization. I used some of the code [here](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/) and mostly worked on researching which style layers performed best in the neural style transfer task. Notebook will follow.

## Predicting Housing Prices

A project for the course Introduction to Machine Learning. All students were asked to take part into the following kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/). In order to get the highest grade for the course you simply had to end up at the highest position of your class. I scored 1st within the class and 33th on the leaderbord. I averaged the results of XGboost, Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge and Gradient Boosting Regressor in order to get the best results. All feature engineering can be found in the notebook.

## Data Science Portfolio 

This portfolio consists of several notebooks and projects illustrating the work I have done during my studies (MSc Data Science & Entrepreneurship). It should be noted that some notebooks were not part of my master which I created merely to educate myself.

###  [NLP: Analyzing WhatsApp Messages](https://github.com/MaartenGr/soan/blob/master/soan.ipynb)
* Created a package that allows in-depth analyses on whatsapp conversations
* Analyses were initially done on whatsapp messages between me and my fianciee to surprise her with on our wedding
* Visualizations were done in such a way that it would make sense for someone not familiar with data science
* Methods: Sentiment Analysis, TF-IDF, Topic Modeling, Wordclouds, etc.

###  [Optimizing Emt√© Routes](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/RouteOptimization.ipynb)
* Project for the course Business Analytics in the master
* Optimization of managers visiting a set of cities
* Total of 133 cities, max distance 400km with time and capacity constraints
* Thus, a vehicle routing problem
* Methods: Integer Linear Programming, Tabu Search, Simmulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, Python

###  [Predicting and Optimizing Auction Prices](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/AuctionAnalysis.ipynb)
* Data received from an auction house and therefore not made public
* Prediction of value at which an item will be sold to be used as an objective measure
* Optimize starting price such that predicted value will be as high as possible
* Methods: Classification (KNN, LightGBM, RF, XGBoost, etc.), LOO-CV, Genetic Algorithms, Python

###  [Statistical Analysis using the Hurdle Model](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/AuctionAnalysis.ipynb)
* Used Apple Store data to analyze which business model aspects influence performance of mobile games
* Two groups were identified and compared, namley early and later entrants of the market
* The impact of entry timing and the use of technological innovation was analyzed on performance
* Methods: Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression, Hurdle model, Python, R

###  [Predict and optimize demand](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/simulation.ipynb)
* Part of the course Data-Driven SCM
* Optimizing order quantity based on predicted demand using machine learning methods
* Simulation model was created to check performance of method calculating expected demand
* Additional weather features were included
* Methods: Regression (XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost), Bayesian Optimization (Skopt)

###  [Google Takeout]()
* Analyzing my own data provided by Google Takeout
* Location data, browser search history, mail data, etc.
* So far, started with visualizing my location data from where I live, Tilburg

### [Neural Style Transfer]()
* For the course deep learning I worked on a paper researching optimal selection of hidden layers to create the most appealing images in neural style transfer while speeding up the process of optimization
* Code is not yet provided as I used most of the following code from [here](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/) and I merely explored different layers

###  [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/MaartenGr/Projects/blob/master/Notebooks/HousingPrices.ipynb)
* Project for the course Machine Learning
* Participation of the kaggle competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/)
* We were graded on leaderboard scores and I scored 1st of the class with position 33th of the leaderboard
* I used a weighted average of XGBoost, Lasso, ElasticNet, Ridge and Gradient Boosting Regressor
* The focus of this project was mostly on feature engineering

###  [FitBit](https://github.com/MaartenGr/fitbit/)
* My first data science project
* I looked at improving the quality of FitBit's heartrate measurement as I realized it wasn't all that accurate
* Used a simple 10-fold CV with regression techniques to fill missing heart rates
* There are many things that I would do differently now like using other validation techniques that are not as sensitive to overfitting on timeseries
